Welcome to Eclim

*overview*


Overview
========

The primary goal of eclim is to bring Eclipse (http://eclipse.org)
functionality to the Vim (http://vim.org) editor.  The initial goal
was to provide Eclipse's java functionality in vim, but support for
various other languages (c/c++, php, python, ruby, css, html, xml,
etc.) have been added and several more are planned.

Eclim is less of an application and more of an integration of two
great projects. The first, Vim, is arguably
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_wars) one of the best text
editors in existence.  The second, Eclipse, provides many great tools
for development in various languages.  Each provides many features
that can increase developer productivity, but both still leave
something to be desired.  Vim lacks native Java support and many of
the advanced features available in Eclipse. Eclipse, on the other
hand, still requires the use of the mouse for many things, and when
compared to Vim, provides a less than ideal interface for editing
text.

That is where eclim comes into play.  Instead of trying to write an
IDE in Vim or a Vim editor in Eclipse, eclim provides an Eclipse
plug-in that exposes Eclipse features through a server interface, and
a set of Vim plug-ins that communicate with Eclipse over that
interface.  This functionality can be leveraged in three primary ways,
as illustrated below.

1. The first scenario (|eclimd-headless|) is for those for which vim
   is their primary editing interface.  In this scenario you run a
   headless instance of eclipse which all vim instances can then
   communicate with to provide the various eclipse features.

2. The second scenario (|eclimd-headed|) is for those who prefer using
   vim as their main interface, but frequently end up jumping back to
   eclipse for any features not provided by eclim.  In this case you
   can run the eclim server inside of the eclipse gui and then
   interact with it via external vim instances just like the first
   scenario.

3. The last scenario (|gvim-embedded|) is for those who wish to use
   the eclipse interface full time, but want to use gvim as an
   embedded eclipse editor. Just like the previous use case, the eclim
   server is run inside of the eclipse gui and the embedded gvim will
   interact with it just like external vim instances would.

Eclim 1.4.0 is now available.
Please note that eclim now requires the latest version of eclipse (http://eclipse.org)

Also note that the eclipse pdt plugin which serves as the base for
eclim's php support has not yet been released for the latest version
of eclipse.  For this reason php support has been temporarily removed
from this release and will hopefully return soon after the pdt team
release a Ganymede (3.4) compatible version.

Another major change worth noting, is that eclim is now licensed under
the GPLv3.  This was done to give eclim the freedom to integrate with
other GPL projects in the future.
