Archive Viewer
**************

Eclim includes a plugin which allows you to view the contents of
archive files (jar, tar, tbz2, tgz, zip, and more).

>

   $ vim myarchive.tar.gz

<


Unlike the tar and zip plugins that ship with vim, the eclim version
gives you the option to view and navigate the archive in a tree or
list interface, and supports nested archives.

When viewing the archive you can switch layouts by using :AsList to
switch from the tree layout to the list, and :AsTree to switch back.

There are also various mappings depending on the view:

- Tree

  - <enter> - View the file under the cursor in a new split window, or
    in the case of a directory, expand / collapse it.

  - o - For files, this has the same behavior as <enter>. For
    directories, it will fold / unfold open directories preserving the
    state of all the sub directories.

  - p - Jumps to the nearest parent directory.

  - P - Jumps to the furthest child in the currect branch of
    directories.

  - i - Prints the size and date for the file under the cursor.

- List

  - <enter> - View the file under the cursor in a new split window.
