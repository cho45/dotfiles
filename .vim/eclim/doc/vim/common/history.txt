Local History
*************

When editing files, vim provides great undo support.  However, the
undo information is lost when you close a file or utilize one of the
few eclim features that require a reload of the current file.

Eclipse provides a nice feature which can help combat both of these
deficiencies.  It includes support for a local history, which is
basically a simplistic version control system that is updated every
time you save a file. Using this local history, you can view diffs
against previously saved versions of your file or revert to one of
those revisions.

By default, as long as eclimd is running, any writes you make to a
file inside of a project will automatically be saved as a local
history revision.

*:History*

:History - Opens a temporary buffer showing the local history for the
current file.  In this buffer you can perform the following actions
using the specified key bindings:

- <cr> - view the contents of the revision under the cursor.

- d - diff the revision under the cursor against the current contents.

- r - revert the current file to the revision under the cursor.

- c - clear the local history for the file.

*:HistoryClear*

:HistoryClear[!] - Clears the local history for the current file.
When the bang (!) is supplied, you are not prompted before clearing
the history.

*:HistoryDiffNext*

:HistoryDiffNext - While the history buffer is open, this command
allows you to diff the current file against the next entry in the
history stack.

*:HistoryDiffPrev*

:HistoryDiffPrev - Just like :HistoryDiffNext but diffs against the
previous entry in the stack.


Configuration
=============

Eclipse Settings

- When writing to the local history, eclim simply proxies the request
  to eclipse, so all eclipse settings are honored.  To modify these
  settings you currently have to do so inside of the eclipse gui.
  First shut down eclimd if you are running a headless version, then
  open the eclipse gui and navigate to:

  >
     Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Local History

  <

  And there you can edit your settings as necessary.

Vim Settings

*g:EclimHistoryDiffOrientation*

- g:EclimHistoryDiffOrientation (Default: 'vertical') - When
  initiating diffs, this setting controls whether the diff window is
  opened as a horizontal split or vertical.  Supported values include
  'horizontal' and 'vertical'.
