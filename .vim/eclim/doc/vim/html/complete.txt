Html Code Completion
********************

Html code completion uses the standard Vim code completion mechanism
(|vim-code-completion|) like so:

>

   <ht<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <he<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <lin<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <link ty<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <link type
   ...

<


In addition to the standard code completion, eclim also supports auto
completion of end tags. When you type '</' eclim will attempt to
determine which element you are closing and complete it for you.  If
you wish to disable this feature you can simply set
g:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTag to 0.

Warning: Html completion has been disabled on Windows when using the headless
  version of eclim because of a native call which blocks indefinitely.
  Hopefully in the future this issue will be resolved or a work around
  found.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables

*g:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTag*

- g:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTag - If set to 0, disables auto completion of
  end tags.

*g:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTagIgnore*

- b:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTagIgnore - Buffer local variable that can be
  set to a list of tags to ignore when searching for the start tag to
  complete.

  Example that can be added to an html ftplugin file:

  >
     let b:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTagIgnore = ['br', 'input']

  <
