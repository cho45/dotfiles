Wsdl Validation
***************

When editing a wsdl file eclim will default to validating the file
when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

If you do not want your wsdl files validated automatically when saved,
you can set the |g:EclimWsdlValidate| variable described in the
configuration section below.

*:Validate_wsdl*

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command :Validate to manually execute the validation of the file.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables

*g:EclimWsdlValidate*

- g:EclimWsdlValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables validation
  when saving the file.

- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
