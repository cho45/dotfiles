To facilitate quick access of Vim help for elements of a Vim script,
eclim provides the command :VimDoc.  When executed it will open the
help docs for the supplied argument or for the element under the
cursor.  When mapped to a key binding of your choosing, this command
can save you some repetitive typing and provides an internal map of
some keywords to their help topic, which are not always as straight
forward as :help word.

Note: If you come across any instances where this command does not find
  the expected Vim help topic, please report it so that it may be
  accounted for in future revisions.
