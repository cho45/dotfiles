Vim Find
********

When working on Vim scripts, eclim provides a set of commands for
finding user defined commands, functions, and global variables.

*:FindCommandDef*

- :FindCommandDef [command] - Finds the definition of the supplied
  command name or command name under the cursor.

*:FindCommandRef*

- :FindCommandRef [command] - Finds references of the supplied command
  name or command name under the cursor.

*:FindFunctionDef*

- :FindFunctionDef [function] - Finds the definition of the supplied
  function name or function name under the cursor.

*:FindFunctionRef*

- :FindFunctionRef [function] - Finds references of the supplied
  function name or function name under the cursor.

*:FindVariableDef*

- :FindVariableDef [variable] - Finds the definition of the supplied
  global variable name or variable name under the cursor.

*:FindVariableRef*

- :FindVariableRef [variable] - Finds references of the supplied
  global variable name or variable name under the cursor.

*:FindByContext*

- :FindByContext - Performs the appropriate search for the element
  under the cursor based on its context.  If the cursor is on a
  command, function, or variable definition, then this command will
  search for references of that command, function, or variable.  If
  the cursor is on a reference of a command, function, or variable,
  then this command will search for the definition of the command,
  function, or variable.

All of the above commands support ! which can be used to prevent
jumping to the first of mulitple results found.  In the case of a
single result, you can set the g:EclimVimFindSingleResult variable to
determine the action to take, as described below.
